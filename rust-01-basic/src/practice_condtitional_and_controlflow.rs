// Problem 1:
/*
Write a program to find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N numbers.
N will be a user-defined input that your program will take.

For example, if the user enters the number 5, you should compute the square of the sum as (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)^2 = 225.
Next, compute the sum of the squares as (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2) = (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25) = 55.
Finally, calculate the difference as 225 - 55 = 170.

// Note: The pow() method in Rust is used to raise a number to an integer power.
// Example: If we want to compute 2 raised to the power 3, then the syntax
// will be 2.pow(3).
// If we want to compute a variable raise to the power of some value,
// then the following syntax can be used.
// let number: u32 = 5;
// let square = number.pow(2); // This computes square of the variable number
